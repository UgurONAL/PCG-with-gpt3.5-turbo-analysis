Here are the symbols used: - `#` represents a wall. - `@` represents the player. - `$` represents a storage location. - `.` represents a crate. - ` ` (space) represents an empty space. Each level should be a solvable puzzle where all crates can be moved to storage locations. The player should start at a reasonable position within the level. There should be only one player in a level. The number of crates and storage locations should be equal."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a Sokoban level with a size of 9x9."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " ## #####\n## ## . #\n# ## $. #\n ## $   #\n## $@ ###\n# $  ##\n#.. ## ##\n#   # ##\n##### #"}]}
